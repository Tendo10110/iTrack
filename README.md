ESP32 Camera and GPS Integration with Edge Impulse and Firebase

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of an ESP32-based camera module with GPS functionality, Edge Impulse machine learning inference, and Firebase for data storage and retrieval. The code is designed to capture images, perform object detection using a pre-trained Edge Impulse model, and log GPS coordinates along with inference results to Firebase.

 Key Components and Libraries
- ESP32 Camera**: Captures images using the AI-Thinker camera module.
- TinyGPS**: Parses GPS data from a GPS module connected via SoftwareSerial.
- Edge Impulse SDK**: Runs machine learning inference on the captured images.
- Firebase**: Stores and retrieves inference results and GPS data.
- ESP32Firebase**: Manages Firebase communication.

Hardware Configuration
The hardware setup involves connecting an AI-Thinker camera module and a GPS module to an ESP32 board. The pin definitions and camera configurations are specified for the AI-Thinker model.

WiFi Configuration
The code connects to a WiFi network using the provided SSID and password. Ensure you replace `_SSID` and `_PASSWORD` with your actual WiFi credentials.

Camera Initialization
The `ei_camera_init()` function initializes the camera with the specified configurations. If initialization fails, an error message is printed.

Image Capture and Inference
The `ei_camera_capture()` function captures an image, converts it to RGB format, and optionally resizes it. The captured image is then passed to the Edge Impulse classifier for object detection. The results are printed to the serial monitor and pushed to Firebase.

GPS Data Handling
GPS data is parsed using the TinyGPS library. Latitude and longitude values are read and sent to Firebase. If no valid data is received from the GPS module, an error message is printed.

Firebase Interaction
Inference results and GPS coordinates are sent to Firebase using the `firebase.pushString()` and `firebase.pushInt()` methods. Data is then deleted from Firebase to ensure only the latest values are stored.

Code Structure
- Setup Function**: Initializes serial communication, WiFi connection, camera, and prints the IP address.
- Loop Function**: Captures images, runs inference, handles GPS data, and communicates with Firebase in a continuous loop.

Usage
1. Connect the camera and GPS modules to the ESP32 board as per the pin definitions.
2. Update the `_SSID`, `_PASSWORD`, and `REFERENCE_URL` with your WiFi credentials and Firebase URL.
3. Upload the code to the ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Open the serial monitor to view the inference results and GPS data.

Notes
- Ensure the Edge Impulse model is compatible with the camera input specifications.
- Verify the Firebase URL and permissions for data access.
